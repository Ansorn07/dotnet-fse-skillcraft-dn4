# ðŸ§® Advanced SQL â€“ Ranking and Window Functions

This exercise demonstrates how to use SQL window functions to rank products by price within their respective categories.

## ðŸ›’ Scenario: Online Retail Store

You work on a retail analytics platform and are asked to identify the **top 3 most expensive products** in each product category. You are to compare how different ranking functions behave.

## ðŸ“Œ SQL Functions Used
- `ROW_NUMBER()`
- `RANK()`
- `DENSE_RANK()`
- `OVER(PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Price DESC)`

## ðŸ’¡ What Youâ€™ll Learn
| Function       | Description                                                |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ROW_NUMBER()` | Assigns a unique row number to each row in a partition     |
| `RANK()`       | Gives the same rank to ties but skips the next rank        |
| `DENSE_RANK()` | Gives the same rank to ties and doesnâ€™t skip subsequent ones |

## ðŸ“Š Sample Query
```sql
SELECT ProductName, Category, Price,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Price DESC) AS RowNum
FROM Products;
